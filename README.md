# PFS-SPAKE2
Password-based Authenticated Key-Exchange (PAKE) protocols allow the establishment of secure communications despite a human memorable password being the only secret that is previously shared between the participants.  
This project is a python implementation of the PFS-SPAKE2 protocol which provably satisfies the perfect-forward secrecy property.
